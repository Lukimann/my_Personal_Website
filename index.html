        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Luka Wanyama, I am a man of diverse passions, each facet
          contributing to the vibrant mosaic of who I am.<br /><br />
          I am deeply connected to the environment, a staunch advocate for
          sustainable living and eco-friendly practices. Whether I'm nurturing
          green spaces or championing environmental<br />
          causes, my commitment to preserving our planet is unwavering.<br /><br />On
          the rugby field, I find my heart pounding with excitement as I cheer
          on my favorite team, the Springboks. Their victories are not just
          triumphs on the field but reflections of my own values in teamwork and
          unyielding resilience.<br /><br />Currently enrolled in a tech school,
          I am navigating the digital landscape with fervor. My love for
          technology goes beyond casual interest, it's a dedicated exploration
          into the cutting-edge realms of coding, hardware design, and emerging
          innovations. In the dynamic world of tech, I am positioning myself as
          a forward-thinking individual with a keen eye for the future.<br />Away
          from the world of environmentalism and technology, I find solace in
          the rhythms of rhumba, the lyrical flow of hip-hop, and the urban
          vibes that echo my eclectic taste in music. It's through these beats
          that I unwind, finding inspiration in melodies that accompany my
          diverse journey.<br />
          <br />

          In the tapestry of my life, the threads of environmental advocacy,
          rugby fandom, tech enthusiasm, and musical appreciation weave together
          a story of a person who embraces life's richness with a radiant
          spirit. Lumiere is not just a name; it's a reflection of the
          brilliance that shines through in every pursuit.

        <h1>My motto</h1>
        <p>
          Guided by the idea "In life's journey, let your love drive you, your
          strength help you, and your creative ideas lead you." I bring energy
          and excitement to caring for the environment, cheering for rugby, and
          exploring technology. Using new ideas is like my map in the tech
          world, guiding me with smart thinking. This way of living shapes who I
          amâ€”a person who faces life with love, strength, and smart ideas,
          making every step meaningful through the ups and downs.

        <h1>My goals</h1>
        <p>
          In my tech studies, I aim to be a friend to the environment. I dream
          of creating tech solutions that help, not harm. One goal is to make
          Green Tech. Think solar power and energy-saving gadgets. I want to
          design with nature in mind, using materials that won't harm the
          planet. <br /><br />

          Numbers and data are powerful. I want to use my tech skills to
          understand and solve environmental problems. By creating smart
          algorithms, I hope to turn complicated data into simple solutions,
          helping people make eco-friendly choices.
          <br /><br />
          Sharing knowledge is key. I plan to teach others about the cool mix of
          tech and nature. Workshops, seminars, and easy-to-understand materials
          will spread the word. I also want to team up with others on
          open-source projects, where people share ideas and work together for a
          greener future.
          <br /><br />
          Conservation is close to my heart. By using tech to track wildlife,
          monitor deforestation, and stop illegal activities, I hope to protect
          our planet's treasures. I also aim to reduce the carbon footprint of
          tech, making it cleaner and greener. In my tech and environmental
          journey, I promise to keep learning. Staying up-to-date ensures I'm
          part of the latest and greatest ideas to make our world a better
          place. Together, let's build a future where tech and nature thrive
          side by side.
