        <p id="par1">
        My name is Luka W. Wanyama, I am a man of diverse passions, each facet contributing to the vibrant mosaic of who I am.
        <br>I am deeply connected to the environment, a staunch advocate for sustainable living and eco-friendly practices. Whether I'm nurturing green spaces or championing environmental causes, my commitment to preserving our planet is unwavering.<br><br>On the rugby field, I find my heart pounding with excitement as I cheer on my favorite team, the Springboks. Their victories are not just triumphs on the field but reflections of my own values in teamwork and unyielding resilience.<br><br>Currently enrolled in a tech school, I am navigating the digital landscape with fervor. My love for technology goes beyond casual interest, it's a dedicated exploration into the cutting-edge realms of coding, hardware design, and emerging innovations. In the dynamic world of tech, I am positioning myself as a forward-thinking individual with a keen eye for the future.<br>Away from the world of environmentalism and technology, I find solace in the rhythms of rhumba, the lyrical flow of hip-hop, and the urban vibes that echo my eclectic taste in music. It's through these beats that I unwind, finding inspiration in melodies that accompany my diverse journey.<br>
        <br>
        
        In the tapestry of my life, the threads of environmental advocacy, rugby fandom, tech enthusiasm, and musical appreciation weave together a story of a person who embraces life's richness with a radiant spirit. Lumiere is not just a name; it's a reflection of the brilliance that shines through in every pursuit.

        <h2>My Life's motto.</h2>
        <p>
            Guided by the idea "In life's journey, let your love drive you, your strength help you, and your creative ideas lead you." I bring energy and excitement to caring for the environment, cheering for rugby, and exploring technology. Using new ideas is like my map in the tech world, guiding me with smart thinking. This way of living shapes who I amâ€”a person who faces life with love, strength, and smart ideas, making every step meaningful through the ups and downs.
